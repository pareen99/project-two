    <p>Zimbabwe is a small country that many people don't actually know about. Though it is still highly ranked for it's education and was once among the top most successful African countries, the corruption post-independence brought the people to their knees. Where the country once had the ability to hold an impressive reputation among first world countries, it is now only recognized either in textbook definitions of hyperinflation or in reference to dictators and corruption. The Zimbabwean poeple, however, have contiued to fight through every inconsiderate decision made by the government. But enough is enough. A country filled with so muhc potential does not deserve to be treated this way. Therefore the solution to this problme is education; something Zimbabweans are still very good at. By educating the world and opening their eyes to the potential of the country, it is possible to make an actual difference.</p>

        <p> Since the crash of the Zimbabwean dollar in 2009, the local currency consists of US dollars, Zimbabwean bond notes and an electronic currency called the RTGS dollar.
        </p>
        <h5>Bond Notes</h5>
        <p>
            Bond notes are issued by the government -which started out equivalent to the US dollar (later inflated)- to make up for the cash shortage. The bond notes were printed with a loan of US$200 million from the African Export-Import Bank. 
        </p>
        <h5>RTGS Dollars</h5>
        <p>

RTGS dollars price is determined by the market and can be purchased through most forms of payment (debit card, bond notes and mobile phone money).
